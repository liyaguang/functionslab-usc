# Oracle Functions Lab

In this lab you will explore serverless computing using Oracle Functions.

## Oracle Functions and Open Source Fn

Oracle Functions is built on the open source [Fn Project](http://fnproject.io)
and so much of the development experience is exactly the same.  Any experience
you have with open source Fn will be 100% applicable to Oracle Functions. The
key differences are that Oracle Functions is a managed service so there's no
need to start and manage an Fn server (it's truly serverless!) and being a cloud
service Oracle Functions is integrated with the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure
(OCI) identity and access management and with networking.
